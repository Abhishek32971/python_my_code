6.Develop a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error.
 If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table: 
Score Grade >= 0.9 A >= 0.8 B >= 0.7 C >= 0.6 D < 0.6 F
If the user enters a value out of range, print a suitable error message and exit.
