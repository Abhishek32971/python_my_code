the chapter socital impacts talks about how your acitivity on the internet influences your society and also about certain ethics and laws you need to follow,
while using the internet
the first topic in this chapter is digital footprint
in proper terms digital footprints are the records and traces or simply the packets of data you leave behind as you use the internet.these may or may  not be accessable by you.  
digital footprint is quite similar to the footprints in the real world but instead of just letting others know your shoe size it contains information about sites
you visit, social media activity such as posts and tweets,location,passwords,chats,online purchases etc  
there are two types of of digital footprints
passive
the data which is stored without users notice for example some companies track your browser history, sites track your ip addresses,and purchasing habbits 
to recomend the best product that you are sure to buy and under stand your preferances.ex amazon happens to recoment the product u searched for on the internet 
when it comes to 
active    
the data which is stored deliberately by the user is called active eg:social media posts ,comments etc 
when it comes to digital footprints it is important to know that they can be used to trace back to the individual whosever the data it is.

some of us might get a doubt about cookies on whether they are active or passive digital footprints.
as we all know cookies are programmes or data globules that are used to traack you.  
cookies are actually not considered as active or passive as it depends on the tracker or sites that use it,they can use it actively or passively
when i say actively you might have observed certain sites ask your to agree to a cookies agreement even before letting you into the website


so it is best to keep this in mind while using the internet that  your digital footprint contains a gist of your personality and also that sometimes companies and 
colleges use the digital footprint to consider an individual for a sensitive job or for aceepting a student into an institution.this is  mostly the case in certain 
ivy league universities  such as harvard or prinston which consider the social media timeline while letting an idividual study in their university.
it is important to keep your digital footprint clean considering cybersecurity also in mind as hackers are known to use this sensitive data against the individual.
digital footprints grow as yourtime on the internet increases 
so that concludes my topic. 
does anyone have any question regarding? 





so that concludes my sminar thankyou.
